## Getting Started with the eComm Toolkit

### Extensions Installation Parameters & Setup

### Extension Snippets

Since the eComm Toolkit requires a number of "Instance Parameters", we recommend providing a number of extension snippets for ease of use and to ensure functionality. By including Snippets in an extension registration, you'll be able to quickly configure properties when you're editing/creating a Content Schema that are automatically associated with an extension.

The Instance Parameters are all included in the snippets and will drive how the extension looks and functions, and what type of data will be retrieved from your eComm platform.

You can find the code for all snippets in [data/snippets.json](./data/snippets.json) or in the following pages:
